V0.2:
- Rewrote how the config is changed and recognised during installation
- Added an update script, aswell as a new config entry for storing the installed version. This should give the upgrade script the opportunity do do whatever it needs regardless what version you upgrade from.
- Added version check to index and admin page to ensure upgrade has been done before new features can be accessed!
- Cleaned up admin interface a bit(Users has been removed from the Dropdown, and given its own button;  added general settings page)
- When pariox cannot find an uploaded image (because it cannot access/find the temp PHP directory) it will now return the proper error instead of complaining thats it's a permission error
- Enabled directinking option.

V0.1:
- Initial commit
